# HyperPlane-Shifting
This repository is a MATLAB version of hyperplane shifting algorithm that can be used to represent available wrench set facets. The available wrench set is the set of wrenches that can be generated at platform, this set is a convex polytope which is a type of zonotope. The characterization of the facets of available wrench set are visualized using the scripts.

# Graphic Mockup

A library of graphical and computational tools has been written in order to simplify the analysis and to provide a sophisticated and effective mockup.
